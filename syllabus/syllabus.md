The objective of the internship is for you to gain experience working in
a professional setting.  You will see how your classroom knowledge is
applied to the work that energy professionals do.

There are three requirements for your internship.

1. Submit the Internship Agreement form before beginning work.
2. Schedule a mid-internship meeting with me to discuss your progress.
3. Submit your end of semester report.


## Internship Agreement

  print and get signatures.
- After all signatures are complete, in the office, create a scanned
  copy and send to me via email.

## Mid-Internship Meeting

Schedule an office hours appointment with me to discuss your internship
progress so far.


## End of Semester Report

At the end of the semester, you will submit the following materials.

1. Summary sheet with the title of your internship, names and contact
information for the company and your supervisor, dates, and number of
units
2. Your time and activities log demonstrating that you have fulfilled
the 180 hour time requirement.
3. A two-page summary of your intership that highlights your learning
experiences both valuable and less valuable.  This is important for
future students.
4. A sample of work you completed during your internship.

Submit these files in a single PDF copy to my email or upload to Moodle.

You will also arrange to have a one-page letter of evaluation sent from your
internship supervisor to me via email.

# Grading

This course is graded on a Credit/No-Credit basis.  Be sure you fill
this out correctly on the form.

# Finding an internship

This is one of the more challenging aspects of the internship.  It is
your responsibility to identify and pursue opportunities which will be
good practice for your entry into the job market.

- Identify the type of experience you want to gain.  Do you want a
  technical internship, a marketing internship, or something else?  Once
  you have this is mind you can look for companies doing what you are
  interested in.
- Identify possible companies.  Look for companies in the area that are
  doing the work you are interested in.
- Reach out to these companies.  Do you know students who have already
  held internships at these companies?  Can you get an introduction?
  You can also send a brief and professional email if you do not have a
  way to get an introduction.
